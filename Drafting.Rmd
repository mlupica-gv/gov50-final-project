## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

cdi <- read_csv("C:/Users/18mia/Downloads/U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_.csv")

hisp_data <- cdi |>
  filter(Stratification1 == "Hispanic")

hisp_data

```
```{r}
hisp_plot <- hisp_data|>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = TopicID)) + geom_bar(fill = "lightblue")+ labs(x= "Chronic Disease Category", y = "Reported Counts", title = "Chronic Disease Recorded in Hispanic Populations")

hisp_plot

overall_plot <- cdi|>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= TopicID)) + geom_bar( fill = "royalblue4") + labs(x= "Chronic Disease Category", y = "Reported Counts", title = "Chronic Disease Recorded in General Population")

overall_plot
```
```{r}

cdi|>
  group_by(Stratification1, Topic)|>
  lm(DataValue ~ Stratification 1, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r}
